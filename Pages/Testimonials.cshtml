             The sign I picked out was for my daughter&rsquo;s nursery and it turned out even better than I imagined! It is something we will cherish for years to come. I was able to communicate with the shop owners to make sure the
            sign was exactly what I wanted, as far as font and colors, etc. and everything came together beautifully! They were able to ship my item quickly too! I LOVE my sign and highly recommend this shop!

             I had about 2 weeks notice to get a gift for my coworker and MemorableGiving (Julie) really delivered quick and quality work. From the very beginning, she was responsive and provided &nbsp;me multiple fonts and proofs to
            choose from. We finalized details and she had everything shipped within 5 days - I was so surprised to see it arrive from ID to CA within a few days and was amazed by how great it looked. We had the baby shower yesterday and
            everybody was obsessed with it. I would definitely order from this shop again and would highly recommend you do too!

             Totally outstanding service and product from this fantastic shop! We cannot recommend Julie and her shop highly enough. We were stuck in a bind after the sign we&#39;d originally ordered from a different company, never
            arrived... and the shop owner wouldn&#39;t respond to us. We found Memorable Giving, who rescued my hopes for a beautiful nursery sign for our newborn daughter, immediately designing this stunning, even-better sign on a
            weekend and shipping it out ASAP in time for our newborn portraits. Julie got to work instantly and communicated with me until the sign arrived. Talk about going above and beyond for a customer! The sign is the centrepiece
            of our nursery and I will always associate with this special time in our lives. Our photographer, friends, and family are all amazed by it too! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!

             Giving 5 stars for customer service and quick responses fast shipping compared to similar shops with this type of product on Etsy. Great quality. If you are particular and OCD like me this was a challenge because the
            colors and stains to me were misleading and did not look like the proof. Shop was gracious and recreated me another piece.

             I absolutely love my nursery sign. It turned out even better than I had hoped. I was a little nervous about the stain colors and asked a million questions but Julie was very patient with me and always responded super
            quick. I&rsquo;m a little ocd and can be a difficult customer bc of it I guess but I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with how my sign turned out. I contacted Julie bc I was getting worried that my son was going to make an early
            arrival and she even expedited getting my sign finished and in the mail sooner. Great seller and super happy customer here. Thanks so much for everything, Julie! I really appreciate it!

             Perfect addition to our son&rsquo;s woodland themed nursery! Very high quality. I thought the wood would be a little darker stain (I selected mahogany) , and would match my walnut &amp; white crib but it is a little
            lighter than I expected. It is great to be able to see the proof of the fonts and colors before ordering too.

            image that wasn&rsquo;t currently available as an example on her site. If we were having more kids, I&rsquo;d order all the name signs from her ) they&rsquo;re just remarkable, excellent quality and beautifully crafted.

             This name sign exceeded my expectations. It&#39;s even more beautiful in person than it is in the pictures. The seller sent a proof right away, which was very helpful since I realized that I wanted to change some colors
            after seeing what it would look like. The seller changed the colors I wanted almost immediately and then processed my order. I&#39;m very happy with my purchase!

             This is the 3rd name sign that I&#39;ve purchased and all 3 have turned out amazing. The seller is incredibly easy to work with and was even able to customize the animal on our sign to match our nursery theme. We received
            our order fairly quickly and it was well-packaged. If you are on the fence about purchasing, just do it. You won&#39;t regret it!

             Absolutely love our name sign! Julie helped me customize one of her designs with colors and fonts, and the canoe we added to the lake was the perfect touch! I am obsessed with this name sign for our son! Julie was easy to
            work with, responded quickly, and provided a few mock-ups to help me decide on the best colors and fonts for the sign. Her work is beautiful!

            we are going to utilize the name board with the backdrop for the baby shower.
